# BinaryTreeTraversal-Java
This repository contains a simple Java implementation of a binary tree with three types of traversal methods: in-order, pre-order, and post-order. The program allows users to input numbers to construct the binary tree and then displays the results of each traversal.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Structure:** Supports inserting nodes and creating a binary search tree.
- **Traversal Methods:** Includes in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal methods.
- **User Input:** Users can input a list of numbers, which will be added to the binary tree.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BinaryTreeTraversal-Java.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (like VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

3. Compile and run the Main.java file.

4. When prompted, enter a list of numbers separated by spaces to build the tree.

5. The program will output the in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of the tree.
